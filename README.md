# Chronic pain in HIV

Analysis scripts for a study investigating the prevalence of chronic pain in the South African population according to HIV status.

All data are available through the DHS Program website (https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset/South-Africa_Standard-DHS_2016.cfm)

## Abstract
*Objectives:* Using data from the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey for South Africa, the study was undertaken to: 1) estimate the prevalence of chronic pain in a group of people who had tested positive for HIV, and 2) compare the prevalence of chronic pain between the group that tested positive for HIV and the group that had tested negative for HIV. 

*Design:* A national, cross-sectional survey, using a stratified two-stage sample design.  

*Methods:* All respondents were asked whether they currently had pain or discomfort, and if so, then had that pain or discomfort persisted for at least three months (operational definition for chronic pain). Blood samples were taken from a sub-sample of respondents, and tested for HIV (using three separate assays to confirm test outcome). 

*Results:* Data from 6584 individuals older than 15 years, who had completed the pain questions and who were tested for HIV, were analysed. 55% of the group was female, and  19% tested positive for HIV. The prevalence of chronic pain was 19% (95% CI: 16 to 23) in the HIV-positive group. This prevalence was similar to that found in the group with negative HIV test results [20% (95% CI: 18 to 22); odds ratio = 0.92 (95% CI: 0.74 to 1.16), p-value = 0.488]. 

*Conclusions:* The prevalence of chronic pain did not differ according to HIV status, indicating that HIV infection does not increase the odds of having chronic pain.
